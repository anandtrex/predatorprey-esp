This paper attempts to decompose the overall task into subtasks which the agent learns separately, and later uses this knowledge of the simpler subtasks to solve the overall task. Both NEAT and ESP were used to evolve networks for the subtasks, and combine the networks for both the simpler subtasks and the overall tasks. We show that decomposing the domain into sub-tasks enables the predator agent to learn much faster than if it were learning it all in one go.
