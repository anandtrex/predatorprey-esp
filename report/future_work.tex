\section{Future Work}
The work done in this paper has a lot of scope for extensions. One of the simplest would be to try to evolve modular networks for multiple predators and prey and hunters. This would introduce a new sub-goal into the task -- the predator agents learning to cooperate among themselves to capture the prey, or maybe even to draw the hunter away from the agent chasing the prey. The overall network would have to learn to cooperate apart from combining the outputs from the sub-networks for chasing prey and avoiding hunters. A similar extension would be using teams of predators and prey.
    Testing the method with a larger number of subtasks that have dependencies among themselves, similar to that described in Stoneâ€™s paper would be another possible future work. Being able to evolve an arbitrary heirarchy of subtasks for a given environment would be quite useful for complicated tasks.

A interesting modification in the neuroevolution method would be to co-evolve the sub-networks for the subtasks along with the overall network. This might give us more compatible networks that perform better in the overall task.
